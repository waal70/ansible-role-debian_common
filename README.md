Common
=========

This is the role that sets some defaults. You might say, a bootstrap role.

The role will check basic requirements. It will then determine the correct
course of action (mainly, "proper" Debian or Raspberry Pi debian)

This role should be safe to run on all machines, always

Requirements
------------

It requires a Debian instance, set-up by the preseed.
It will also accept a default Raspbian OS.
It also presumes a live sudo package.
Make sure at least the SSH-key for user ansible is set.

If you have proxmox-ve servers, for which Dell firmware should NOT be installed,
be sure to have them in a group called 'proxmox_servers'

Role Variables
--------------

None
